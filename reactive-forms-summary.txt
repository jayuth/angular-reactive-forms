Reactive forms:
input element state: pritine, dirty 

-FormControl - track values and states for an individual input element such as an input box
-FormGroup - track values and states of a group of form controls -> <form (ngSubmit)="save()"> ... </form>

-Form Model - data structure that represents the HTML form

-Template-driven forms - data binding is key
--use ngModel for two-way binding to allow data property value in a component class and user-entered entries in sync
--Angular automatically generates the Form Model, formGroup, and formControl instances for us 

-Reactive forms - no data binding in the HTML template
--shift the responsibilities for creating form model to a class 
--template - bind input elements to the form model (instead of binding them to data model properties) defining in the component class 
--Anular will not create a form model for us. Instead, we create it ourself in a component clas 
-- no need for template reference variable 
--no two-way binding 
--validation is defined in a class - this means no validation attribute in the HTML template
--we still have a from element that includes 'formGroup' directive to bind to the form model defined in a component class
--each input element has to have formControlName directive

-Directives
--template-driven - to get a form control state, use hash-tag e.g. #firstNameVar to create template reference variable 

-touched element - when a user enters and leaves the field without modifying it resulting in blank field
-dirty element- when a text is entered to an input box

Chapter 4: Building a reactive form
-less HTML code and more code in component class 
-Form Model
--root FormGroup contains properties to retain state 
--FormControl for each input element but not every input element needs to have FormControl to track changes such as check box 
--nested FormGroups
--FormArrays
-data model != form model
- a form group includes a set of form control 
-Accessing the form model properties to check the state of an input element such as if the firstName form control property was touched or valid

[ngClass]="{'is-invalid': (customerForm.get('firstName').touched || customerForm.get('firstName').dirty) && !customerForm.get('firstName').valid }" />

example for firstName:
the firstName becomes valid when (dirty) texts are entered up to 3 characters. This means if dirty is false, valid is also false (!customerForm.get('firstName').valid means 'invalid') 
true || false (not entered any char) = true && true = true
true || false (entered chars < 3) = true && true = true
true || true (entered chars > 3) = true && false = false

-Update input element on the form from a component class
--setValue - every formControl property needs to be set. Otherwise, an error will occur.
--patchValue - some property can have missing value.

-FormBuilder  
--provided as a service
--no need to create an instance of FormGroup
--as usual, import ReactiveFormsModule to the Angular Module

 /* without using FormBuilder, you need to create an instance of FormGroup and FormControl 
    this.customerForm = new FormGroup({
      // input elements
      firstName: new FormControl(),
      lastName: new FormControl(),
      email: new FormControl(),
      // set a default value of sendCatalog to true
      sendCatalog: new FormControl(true)
    });
    */

Summary:
Template:
-bind the form element to the FormGroup property defined in a Component Class - [formGroup] 
-bind each input element to its associated FormControl defined in a Component Class - formControlName 

Chapter 5: Validation
-the first argument of a FormControl is a default value. The second arg is validation rule. 
--If there are multiple rules, create an array of rules
-Adjusting validation rules at runtime/ on the fly  
--e.g. when the user clicks the email checkbox, the phone field will be optional 
--when the user clicks the text checkbox, the email field will be optional, and the phone field will be required 
-Custom validator
-- e.g. rating: 1 to 5
-- true when i > 5, i < 1, i != number, i == null 
i > 0 && i <= 5

--less than 0 means 'after 0'. This still counts zero
--Factory function is used when creating a custom validator and passing a parameter

-Cross-field Validation using nested FormGroup
--e.g. email field and confirm email field

-when an error occurs, the broken validation rule name will be added to an error collection for the FormGroup, not the individual FormControl

rating 1-5

value == number?
value > 0 
value <= 5

-not matching email validation performs when:
emailControl = prestine
OR
confirmControl = prestine
-if either fields are prestine then null. e.g. email is touched but confirmEmail is not. At this point we can't compare email and confirm email yet 
because we only have an email value but missing confirmEmail value.
-if both are touched, we can validate if entered chars match
if(emailControl.pristine || confirmControl.pristine){
    return null;
  }
T || T = null
F || T = T
F || F = F

Chapter 6: Reacting to changes
use valueChanges as an event binding
***syntax for watching value cahnges in FormControl
this.customerForm.get('emailGroup.email');
-customerForm is a FormGroup instance
-emailGroup is a nested FormGroup
-email is a FormControl

-Error collection contains rule names

--valueChanges issue - no notification for focus value when the element is touched , error appears before the user finishes filling their input field 
e.g. the user starts filling an email field but the error appers for them as 'invalid email' as soon as they type the first character
this can be fixed by using debounceTime and throttleTime (emits a value, then ignored the subsequent values for a specific amount of time)

Chapter 7: Dynamically duplicate input elements
-if you want to duplicate multiple elements, use the FormGroup
-FormArray holds a group of FormControl or FormGroup, access by index array

rating
range: 1 to 5
invalid conditions:
1. value > 5 = 6,7,8...
2. value < 1 = 0,-1,-2,...
-define possible conditions like above
value can only be either > 5 or < 1 but not BOTH.
So, we define value > 5 || value < 1  
if either condition is false, then it's invalid
3. if it's not a number = isNaN(value) && if value is not null (because the default of rating field is null)

FormArray is used to hold multiple instances of the same input elements (FormGroup/FormControl)
Loop through the FormArray

**using a square bracket when working with a variable such as <div [formGroupName]="i">

attribute binding - attr.for
[disabled]="!addresses.valid" - the user can't add another address if the previous address is invalid or not done filling 

Summary:
-Define the input element(s) to duplicate
-define a FormGroup if needed
-refactor to make copies - create an instance of a FormControl
-Create a FormArray - to hold multiple instances of duplicate elements
-Loop through the FormArray - using ngFor in the template
-Duplicate the input element(s) - add an add button to allow the user to acreate another address

Chapter 8: routing to a form
CanActivate - check before routing a route
CanDeactivate - check before leaving a current rout to another route

<li><a class='nav-link' [routerLink]="['/products', '0', 'edit']">
      Add Product</a></li>
0 in the url means user wants to add a new product

ACME application architecture
-/products/0/edit tied to ProductEditComponent class and product-edit.component.html


parameter changed without leaving the page, use an Observable 
--e.g. the user could click add product while on the product edit form

-HTTP requests are asynchronous which means while we are waiting for the HTTP response, 
our application can still operate such as handling other user interactions and more.
At some point in the future, the request is processed and we recieved the response.

Chapter 9: CRUD
steps:
-import the Angular Http Service - import HttpClientModule to app.module.ts
-Create the data access service
-Inject the Angular Http Service
-Import Observableand the observable operators
-Write the code to issue each Http request

How routing works for product-detail.component.html
-Edit button:
--[routerLink]="['/products', product.id, 'edit']"> // here only product.id is a variable
--product.id is retrieved from ProductService
--this will route to product-edit.component.html. Since the product.id is not 0, in the product-edit.component.ts,
the pageTitle value property will be set to 'Add Product'.

In Add Product/Edit Product page, if the FormGroup is dirty and the user attempts to leave the page, 
CanDeactivate will be raised and ask if the user wants to leave:
--if yes, the form will be cleared out, and the url is changed to /products/0/edit
---the product id now is 0 so it navigates to 'Add Product' page
--if no, the user will keep staying in the current page  

--feature to add: edit product> if the product hasn't been editied , disable the 'Save' button. Otherwise, enable

Since we use Reactive Forms, we don't use ngModel for two-way binding 
so how can we mensure that data ib the backend in sync with the data entered by the user?

Post vs Put
Post (api/products)
-w/o specifying Id
-create a new resource when the server assigns the Id
-update a set of resources
-we use POST when we want to create a new product to allow the server to assign the appropriate Id

Put(api/products/5) -> update product with Id=5 if it exists. If not, create a new product with Id=5
-replaces data for a specific resource with an Id
-create/update a the resource with the Id

Asynchronous workflow:
1.updateProduct(p) is called passing in p which is an updated product
2.Then when the Http response including an Observable is returned from the updateProduct method, the subscribe will be notified/called
3.if the product is saved successfully, we call onSaveComplete for final processing  

Summary:
Data Access Service & CRUD
In a service class (product.service.ts):
-create a method for each http request in a service class 
-call the desired http method, pass in the Url
-add error handling

Use the service:
-inject the Data Acess Service
-call the subscribe method of the retruned observable
-provide a function to handle an emiited item
-provide an error function to handle any returned errors

Final chapter:
Template driven
-use a template to generate a Form Model to track forms and input elements.
-two-way binding

Reactive Forms 
- we build a Form Model in a component class using FormBuilder. The template then binds to the Form Model 
-instead of two-way binding, we define an immutable data model
